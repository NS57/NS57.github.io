        <p>Hai, welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm working on revamping this page at the moment so stuff might change from time to time</p>

        <fieldset>
            <legend class='title'><b>About</b></legend>
            <p>Hai, my name is Jack and I'm from the UK. I'm 18 and just finished my 2nd year of college studying T-Level software development. I tend to go by they/them :3</p>
            
            <p>I'm into anything involving computers. I usually program & play games in my spare time. I really don't enjoy gaming as much as I used to but idk if it's just me growing up or depression getting me down :c</p>
                
            <p>Until May I was working on the IT team at an architecture firm for my course. It was pretty boring and I spent 90% of my time doing tech support which isn't my kind of job (I don't like dealing with people), but ig it's experience I can put on my CV</p>
            
            <p>I made this site because who wouldn't want their own website? Sadly, I was born too late to see the internet before it was dominated by corporations, now almost every website is a generic page thats plastered with ads</p>
            
            <p>I'm so happy there are still communities around today keeping the early 2000s type of sites around. I love browsing other sites in various webrings and seeing the creativity in each and every one <3</p>
            
            <p>I'm going to be changing this site soon when I have free time, I have a few ideas but I'm still not to sure what I'm going to do. In the future there might be a bit more here</p>
