        <p>Hai, welcome to my website. There isn't much here right now but I might add more eventually.</p>

            <legend><div class='title'>About</div></legend>

            <p>I'm from the UK and was born 26-02-2006, I'm currently in my second year of college studying T-Level software development. 
                I tend to go by they/them.</p>
                
            <p>Im interested in basically anything involving computers or programming and since this year of my course is focusing mainly on web development,
                I thought I would make my own website since I might as well get some practice with this sort of thing, and it feels like ive done nothing but python for years.</p>

            <p>I used to enjoy gaming as well, but honestly now it feels more like I'm doing it since I have nothing better to do rather than because I actually enjoy it as much</p>
