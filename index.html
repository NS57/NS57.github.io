            Hai, welcome to my website. There isn't much here right now, but I might add more eventually.
        </p>

        <fieldset>
            <legend class='title'><b>About</b></legend>
            <p>
                Hai, my name is Jack and I'm from the UK. I was born 26-02-2006 and I'm currently in my second year of college studying T-Level software development. 
                I tend to go by they/them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm into just about anything involving computers. I usually program in my spare time as well as play games, but honestly, gaming 
                feels more like I'm doing it since I have nothing better to do than because I actually enjoy it as much.
            <p>
                Right now, I'm working at an activity centre. It doesn't pay well, and it's not really what I want to be doing, but it just 
                seems so hard to get jobs right now. I had to apply to so many different places before I finally got offered a job.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main reason I made this website is that this year my course is focusing mainly on web development, so I thought I would 
                make my own website since I might as well get some practice with this sort of thing, and it feels like I've done nothing but 
                Python for years.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do want to change this site and make it look better, but I'm not sure exactly how I want it to look yet so it's going to stay 
                like this for the time being.
            </p>

                If, for some reason, you want to chat, feel free to message me on Discord @ nobodyspecial57. I'm fairly active there and will 
                probably respond pretty soon.
