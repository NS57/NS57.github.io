        <p>Hai, welcome to my website. There isn't much here right now but I might add more eventually.</p>

        <div class='title'><p>About</p></div>

        <p>Im from the UK and was born 26-02-2006, Im currently on my second year studying T-Level software development at college. 
            If you want to chat message me on discord @ nobodyspecial57.</p>
        
        <p>Im interested in basically anything involving computers or programming and since this year of my course is focusing mainly on web development,
             I thought I would make my own website since I might as well get some practice with this sort of thing.</p>
